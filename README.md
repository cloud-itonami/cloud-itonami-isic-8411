# cloud-itonami-8411

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC Rev.5 8411**: public administration — case intake, decision, notification and appeal for community services.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for community public administration service:
run by a qualified operator so a community keeps its own operating records
instead of renting a closed SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a service robot performs intake, document handling and dispatch at the counter and in the field under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Public Administration Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
handling citizen data, official decisions and public-works dispatch) require human sign-off.

## Core Contract

```text
intake + identity + identity records
        |
        v
Advisor -> Public Administration Governor -> proceed, hold, or human approval
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.
